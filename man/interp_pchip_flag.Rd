\title{PCHIP Interpolation with Constant Endpoints}
\usage{
interp_pchip_flag(y)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{Numeric vector to interpolate (may contain NAs)}
}
\value{
List with two components:
\describe{
  \item{value}{Numeric vector with interpolated values; NA positions beyond the
    range of observed data are kept constant using the nearest observed endpoint}
  \item{flag}{Integer vector (0/1) indicating which values were originally NA}
}
}
\description{
Performs Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolating Polynomial (PCHIP)
interpolation for missing values within the observed range.
Uses monotone Hermite splines (Fritsch-Carlson method) via \code{\link[stats]{splinefun}}
which are robust to non-linear patterns and avoid overshooting between knots.
Endpoints beyond observed data are held constant (last observation carried forward/backward).

This function replaces the previous linear interpolation approach with a more
sophisticated method that preserves monotonicity and handles non-linear relationships better.
