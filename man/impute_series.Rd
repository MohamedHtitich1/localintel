\title{Full Imputation Pipeline}
\usage{
impute_series(y, years, forecast_to = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{Numeric vector with potential NAs}

\item{years}{Integer vector of corresponding years (length must equal length of y)}

\item{forecast_to}{Integer: the last year to forecast to. If \code{NULL} (default),
no forecasting is performed. If provided and greater than \code{max(years)},
the series is extended with autoregressive forecasts.}
}
\value{
List with four components:
\describe{
  \item{value}{Numeric vector containing the complete imputed and/or
    forecasted series (extended if forecast_to > max(years))}
  \item{years}{Integer vector of years corresponding to the returned values}
  \item{flag}{Integer vector (0/1/2) where 0 = observed, 1 = interpolated gap,
    2 = forecasted future value}
  \item{method}{Character string describing which methods were applied}
}
}
\description{
Combines PCHIP interpolation (for gaps within observed range) with
autoregressive forecasting (for future periods beyond observed data).
This is the recommended entry point for complete time series imputation.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
y <- c(10, NA, NA, 20, 22, 24)
years <- 2018:2023

# Impute internal gaps only
result1 <- impute_series(y, years)

# Impute and forecast to 2025
result2 <- impute_series(y, years, forecast_to = 2025)
}
}
